                                                Appointment Scheduling Optimization

Introduction

The Appointment Scheduling System is a web application designed to manage and schedule appointments with doctors. The system allows 
patients to select available time slots for appointments, ensuring that appointments are scheduled within the current month and on valid dates. 
It also handles error messages and provides feedback to users when necessary.

This system is built using ASP.NET Core MVC, leveraging models, controllers, views, and error handling mechanisms to provide 
a smooth scheduling experience for users.

=========================================================================================================================================
Logic

The core logic of the Appointment Scheduling System revolves around:

1. Doctor Availability: Doctors have predefined available time slots from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day within the current month.
2. Patient Scheduling: Patients can only schedule appointments within the current month, starting from the current date and 
extending to the last day of the month.
3. Slot Selection: The system checks available slots for each doctor, ensuring that appointments are only scheduled within the available times.
4. Error Handling: If a user attempts to schedule an appointment outside of the allowed range or if no available slots are found,
an error message is displayed.

============================================================================================================================================
Models
The system uses the following models:

Model 1: Patient
Represents a patient requesting an appointment.

Id: Unique identifier for the patient.
Name: The patient's name.
ArrivalTime: The desired date and time for the appointment.

Model 2: Doctor
Represents a doctor with available time slots.

Id: Unique identifier for the doctor.
Name: The doctor's name (e.g., Dr. Cedric, Dr. Merwin).
AvailableSlots: A list of DateTime objects representing available time slots for the doctor.

Model 3: Appointment
Represents an appointment that has been successfully scheduled.

Id: Unique identifier for the appointment.
Patient: The patient associated with the appointment.
Doctor: The doctor who will attend to the patient.
ScheduledTime: The scheduled date and time of the appointment.

Model 4: ErrorViewModel
Represents the error view model used for displaying error messages.

ErrorMessage: A string containing the error message.
RequestId: An optional string representing the request ID for debugging purposes.

ErrorViewModel
The ErrorViewModel is used to pass error-related data to the Error view. It contains the error message and, optionally, 
a request ID for debugging purposes.

================================================================================================================================================

Controller
The main controller for handling appointment scheduling is ScheduleController



1. ScheduleController
        Key Methods in 

        - Index(): Displays the list of scheduled appointments.
      
        - Schedule(Patient newPatient): Handles the logic for scheduling a new appointment. It validates the patient's arrival time and 
checks for available slots.
      
        - SchedulePatient(Patient patient): Finds the optimal available slot for the patient and schedules the appointment.

==============================================================================================================================================

Views: create a folder and name it Schedule and add 

1. Index.cshtml
The Index view displays a list of scheduled appointments. It uses the appointments list to show details such as the patient's 
name, the doctor's name, and the scheduled time.

2. Error.cshtml ( it is inside the Shared Folder )
The Error view is used to display error messages when an invalid action occurs (e.g., scheduling an appointment outside of the 
allowed range or when no available slots are found).

It provides the user with feedback about what went wrong, such as the invalid date or time range.
