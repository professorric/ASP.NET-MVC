                                                Appointment Scheduling Optimization

Introduction

The Appointment Scheduling System is a web application designed to manage and schedule appointments with doctors. The system allows 
patients to select available time slots for appointments, ensuring that appointments are scheduled within the current month and on valid dates. 
It also handles error messages and provides feedback to users when necessary.

This system is built using ASP.NET Core MVC, leveraging models, controllers, views, and error handling mechanisms to provide 
a smooth scheduling experience for users.

Logic

The core logic of the Appointment Scheduling System revolves around:

1. Doctor Availability: Doctors have predefined available time slots from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM each day within the current month.
2. Patient Scheduling: Patients can only schedule appointments within the current month, starting from the current date and 
extending to the last day of the month.
3. Slot Selection: The system checks available slots for each doctor, ensuring that appointments are only scheduled within the available times.
4. Error Handling: If a user attempts to schedule an appointment outside of the allowed range or if no available slots are found,
an error message is displayed.

Models
The system uses the following models:

Model 1: Patient
Represents a patient requesting an appointment.

Id: Unique identifier for the patient.
Name: The patient's name.
ArrivalTime: The desired date and time for the appointment.

Model 2: Doctor
Represents a doctor with available time slots.

AvailableSlots: A list of DateTime objects representing available time slots for the doctor.

Model 3: Appointment

Model 4: ErrorViewModel
